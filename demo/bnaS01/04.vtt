～♪

3
00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.623
Damn it, it's no use!

4
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.416
What are you doing?

5
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.545
Uhm, I was trying to go back to my human form...

6
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.381
You're a weird kid.

7
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.511
Ah, more importantly, you have a call from the council.

8
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:35.845
A call?

9
00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.852
It's your beastman registration credential and your insurance card.

10
00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.355
Formalities were still in order, so...

11
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.899
Consider it as a thank you for the bomb incident.

12
00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:49.818
It's been a bit rough for you, right?

13
00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.319
Thank you.

14
00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:54.280
With this, you're now officially part of Animacity.

15
00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.866
Welcome to the Beastmen Capital.

16
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.661
Ah, yeah.

17
00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:00.745
Ah, right!

18
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.705
I'm giving this back.

19
00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.166
Don't worry, you can keep it.

20
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.335
...But I can't use it.

21
00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.256
It doesn't connect to the outside internet, does it?

22
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.300
No matter how many times I tried, only the council site came up.

23
00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:21.057
That's correct. Information on human society is restricted by the Special Beastman Territory Law.

24
00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.183
That's unfair!

25
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.146
Ms. Michiru, this is a good chance, so please remember this.

26
00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:33.820
Beastmen, or rather, the Beastman species is different from the Homo Sapiens species.

27
00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.239
Thanks to a special gene called "Beast Factor"...

28
00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:39.325
...we can freely change our bodies.

29
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.329
In ancient times, beastmen were worshipped by their tribes...

30
00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:45.874
...and made them look like beast gods.

31
00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.960
They wanted to be like gods.

32
00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:53.756
That's why your beast form is decided based on ancestry.

33
00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.300
A lion's child will be a lion.

34
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.762
If two species breed, only one of the parents' attributes will prevail.

35
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:03.057
The resulting child will be either a lion or a tiger.

36
00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.518
It won't be a liger.

37
00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:10.982
Of course, humans without a beast factor can't change into a beastman.

38
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.443
But I...

39
00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:18.156
That's right. The impossible happened to you.

40
00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:26.289
Beastmen have always lived having no contact with the Homo Sapiens... Humans.

41
00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.500
Be it a forest or a mountain, a deserted island, a desert...

42
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:35.465
But due to human environmental development, we had to show ourselves to them whether we wanted to or not.

43
00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:43.890
Since the discovery of the beastman species, there were a couple of conflicts, but we somehow managed to establish Animacity.

44
00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.808
But that's when you came in.

45
00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.395
I researched your genes.

46
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.648
They are different from a regular beast factor.

47
00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:57.779
It's unstable, but an explosion-like cell division occurs when you change shapes.

48
00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:01.658
That's probably the reason behind your ability to freely change your form.

49
00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.618
It's still just a hypothesis, though.

50
00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:04.827
Is it curable?

51
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.412
I don't know that yet.

52
00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.123
Give me some more time.

53
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.293
In any case, please stay with the association.

54
00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.378
Okay...

55
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.300
I kinda get it, but I also don't...

56
00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:22.804
...though I can't use this, that's for sure.

57
00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.722
Heya, tanuki girl!

58
00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:27.392
Ah, it's the weasel...
<i>I said I'm a mink.</i>

59
00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.478
Anyway, I got my hands on some real good stuff! Wanna see?

60
00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.522
No, thank you.

61
00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.524
What?

62
00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.905
Illegal phones that can jump over the Animacity firewall...

63
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.158
If you just want a SIM card, it's 50% off.

64
00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.411
It's a time-limited sale~

65
00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.538
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

66
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:49.664
B-but I don't have...

67
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:50.999
<i>Eight... Seven...</i>
B-but I don't have...

68
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.124
<i>Eight... Seven...</i>

69
00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.542
Can you put it in my tab?
<i>Eight... Seven...</i>

70
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.294
Not my tab, but Shirou's!

71
00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:04.554
My daughter got mad at me recently so I bought an e-cig...

72
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.264
...but that's useless.

73
00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.432
I'm telling the truth.

74
00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.852
…I don't know who distributed the Medical center supplies...!

75
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.648
You were seen by Shirou Oogami.

76
00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:18.401
That's <i>your</i> problem.

77
00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:19.944
Hey, Kusakabe.

78
00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.823
How do we deal with men who can't even take responsibility for their own mistakes?

79
00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:34.208
Flip. I have business with that man.

80
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.171
You'll have to wait.

81
00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:42.008
We're not done here yet.

82
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.018
Stop it!

83
00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.314
Aah, stop i--!

84
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.117
It seems your business is gone.

85
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.519
Hey guys!

86
00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:38.272
Having to go out in a hurry is rough, eh?

87
00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:41.734
For that occasion, I'll be recommending some cosmetics!

88
00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:45.363
Even if you're out of time, you'll look like you put a lot of effort into it!

89
00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.579
Humans are living here?

90
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.127
The foundation I used today is this...

91
00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.211
Excuse me!

92
00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:04.132
Ah, excuse me...

93
00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:05.800
A-are you...

94
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.352
W-what the hell?

95
00:07:16.477 --> 00:07:17.770
Hey, you bastard.

96
00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.731
Who ordered you to get close to the lady?

97
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.734
Uh... Who's the lady?

98
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.320
I mean...

99
00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:29.198
Where am I?

100
00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.326
Don't play dumb.

101
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:37.540
You knew she was The Family's daughter so you closed in on her, didn't you?

102
00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:40.126
The Family?

103
00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.129
Do you mean...

104
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.964
...that one gang?

105
00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.757
Seems you've remembered something.

106
00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:47.967
Spit it out.

107
00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:50.344
What do you want getting close to the lady?!

108
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.514
That's not it! I just happened to see her in Facelook...

109
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.057
<i>Facelook?</i>

110
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.185
Do you know about Facelook?

111
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.063
I happened to come over here just recently...

112
00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.024
You come from the mainland?

113
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.610
No way! That's awesome!!

114
00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:10.990
Really? Where? Tokyo? Shibuya? Harajuku? Omote-sando?

115
00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.742
More from the countryside...

116
00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:14.869
I'm Nina. What's your name?

117
00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.621
Mi... Michiru.

118
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.749
So you were a beastman...

119
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.001
You mean humans were watching me?

120
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:23.920
Amazing!

121
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.464
I show myself as a human on the net.

122
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.674
To hide my shiny beast form~

123
00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:29.967
You can go now.

124
00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.265
Hey, is your dad...

125
00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:39.602
Ugh, I hate my dad.

126
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.229
That's my grandpa.

127
00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:44.273
He was caught by humans before I was born...

128
00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:47.735
...boiled in soy sauce and eaten. It's what my dad says.

129
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.694
What the hell.

130
00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:52.156
Right? There's no way!

131
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:54.825
Just recently I was caught listening to human music...

132
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.661
...so now I'm not allowed outside.

133
00:08:57.161 --> 00:08:59.455
They say it's "indecent and harmful".

134
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.124
I know! Let me show you something cool!

135
00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:05.086
These are my treasures!

136
00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:09.048
They are things that washed up on the beach, or gifts I got!

137
00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:12.009
Is that nostalgic? Do you know what that is?

138
00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.220
It seems just one piece washed up.

139
00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.807
They don't have cables, right?

140
00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:25.439
<i>(NIGHT RUNNING starts playing)</i>

141
00:09:37.868 --> 00:09:40.913
Hey! You're on a diet until the audition. aren't you?

142
00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:42.748
I can eat this!

143
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:49.171
You're really different from everyone else.

144
00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:52.925
People who come here don't wanna talk about the mainland.

145
00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.261
Do you wanna go back?

146
00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:06.397
I can't return looking like this.

147
00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:10.610
I want to go back.

148
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.070
Michiru?

149
00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:18.993
I'm back...? I'm back! How?!

150
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.830
No tail anymore so I can pass through gaps!

151
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.498
I can put hats on!!

152
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:32.214
That's right. This is the real me!

153
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.967
Were you always in beast form?

154
00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:37.803
Ah, uh... Y-yeah!

155
00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:40.389
I forgot how to return to my human form...

156
00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.350
So, you can go back home.

157
00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:44.810
You can go to the mainland!

158
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.195
Nina!

159
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.156
Hold on, Nina!

160
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.662
You know, a girl named Lisa from Facelook...

161
00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.914
...is holding a home party.

162
00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:07.124
I'm invited!

163
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.045
Are you serious?

164
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.381
If you hop onto my back, we'll be there in no time!

165
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.841
If we return quickly, there's no problem, right?

166
00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:20.513
Why do you want to go over there so bad?

167
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:26.602
Only knowing this island my whole life... I don't want that.

168
00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.270
Besides...

169
00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:32.733
The city is sparkling.

170
00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.874
Let's go.

171
00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:51.335
Nina!

172
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:55.297
Papa is back home!

173
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.716
Nina~

174
00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:01.470
Nina?

175
00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:03.931
My deepest apologies!

176
00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:15.276
It was farther than I thought.

177
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.952
Oh no! We gotta hide!

178
00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:26.745
Eh? Why?

179
00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.623
There's police who help beast hunters, too!

180
00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:30.708
Hey, you girls!

181
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.045
It's pretty dark around here, so be careful!

182
00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:39.175
Michiru... You worry too much.

183
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.010
How did you live here?

184
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.849
Ah, it's there!

185
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:26.305
<i>(NIGHT RUNNING starts playing from the speakers)</i>

186
00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:43.280
Michiru!

187
00:13:43.864 --> 00:13:46.867
So this is the taste of macaroons, huh?

188
00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:50.788
Ah, what's wrong? Are you okay?

189
00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.791
Yeah, I'm fine.

190
00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:57.419
You're... glad you came, right?

191
00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.381
Yeah. I'm glad I was able to come back.

192
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:04.093
Hey, Nina!

193
00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:05.594
You're Nina, right?

194
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.306
You really came! We're finally meeting in real life!

195
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.059
Ah, are you Lisa?

196
00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.228
We're finally meeting~!

197
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:20.693
Oh, that's bad...!

198
00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:25.614
No way... No way no way no way!

199
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.578
You were a beastman all along? And you're also a dolphin? So cute!!

200
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:33.789
Help me out, guys.

201
00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:35.708
<i>Let's go!</i>

202
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:37.167
Everyone, listen.

203
00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:41.630
We got a very special guest for our beastman costume party!

204
00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:43.841
A beastman... Nina!

205
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.556
Did you forget yours? I'll let you borrow these.

206
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.853
The pain and suffering that Nina has had to face due to discrimination...

207
00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:58.022
...we can't even being to comprehend it.

208
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.524
I'm sure it was very hard on you.

209
00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:03.152
Eh? I mean, I'm not really...

210
00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:07.239
Let's praise the beauty and courage of Nina's way of living!

211
00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:20.961
Shirou, you got a call!

212
00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:26.091
Oogami, do you know where Michiru is and who she's with?

213
00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:29.553
She's hanging out with Flip's daughter over there.

214
00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.514
If The Family finds out...

215
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.016
...it'll be a big problem.

216
00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:38.020
You want me to take them back home before anything happens.

217
00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.688
<i>Thank you.</i>

218
00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:55.204
You asshole! You wanna die that badly?!

219
00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:57.164
I have business with Flip.

220
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.378
I'm busy now. Move.

221
00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:05.756
Do you plan on starting a war with humans?

222
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:07.967
So what if I do?

223
00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.427
I'll bring your daughter back.

224
00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:12.388
And why would you do that?

225
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:16.934
You can either leave it to me or argue pointlessly here.

226
00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:18.102
Make your choice.

227
00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:21.563
Hm. I'll wait until midnight.

228
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.818
If she doesn't come back before then, you're all turning into minced beef.

229
00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:43.002
Did you see that?

230
00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:46.797
Nina, let's go home.
<i>Why?</i>

231
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:50.134
I don't... I don't know, but...

232
00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:52.052
Something's off.

233
00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.763
This isn't the place I wanted to return to.

234
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.891
Why? Everyone's nice, aren't they?

235
00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:01.729
Don't tell me you don't like this just because I'm the popular one.

236
00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:03.522
What are you talking about?

237
00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:07.483
If that's the case, just go and say you're a beastman too.

238
00:17:07.608 --> 00:17:09.944
I'm not going back home.

239
00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:23.083
What am I doing...?

240
00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:29.131
Yeah.

241
00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.968
I don't care if you left Animacity.

242
00:17:33.093 --> 00:17:33.969
Do what you want.

243
00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:37.139
But return Flip's daughter immediately.

244
00:17:37.264 --> 00:17:39.767
What? How do you know that?

245
00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:43.395
Flip's ready to start a war with humans.

246
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.899
I'm heading over there soon. Figure it out before that.

247
00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:47.858
Got it?

248
00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:50.069
H-hold...! Why so sudden...?

249
00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:54.490
Seeing you entrust work to someone else...

250
00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.408
The sky might as well fall.

251
00:17:56.825 --> 00:17:58.410
Damn it.

252
00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:01.121
<i>That's the first time I've seen a beastman!</i>

253
00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.623
<i>Yeah, me too!</i>

254
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:08.045
<i>But isn't it actually kind of scary? She's like half a beast, isn't she?</i>

255
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.549
RIght? I wouldn't be able to live with her!

256
00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:22.601
What are you doing?!

257
00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:26.688
NIna looked tired, so I thought to put her in the water.

258
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.899
I mean, she's a dolphin, right?

259
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.280
Ah, Nina!

260
00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:36.240
Nina!!

261
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:14.903
Are you okay?

262
00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:19.074
Let's go home.
<i>Yeah...</i>

263
00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:39.428
Michiru...

264
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.931
I'm sorry.
<i>Don't worry.</i>

265
00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:44.892
I'm the one who's sorry.

266
00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:47.853
If you didn't go to the human world...

267
00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.855
...you would still like it.

268
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.525
I should've stopped you.

269
00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:57.571
I don't particularly hate it.

270
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:01.825
I mean, it was really sparkling!

271
00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:07.748
I see.

272
00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:19.968
Didn't you want to return there?

273
00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:23.388
That's right. I wanna leave Animacity.

274
00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:26.725
But not right now.

275
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.270
I wanna know more about beastmen.

276
00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.522
I feel I <i>need</i> to.

277
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.611
That's why I still wanna be in that city.

278
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.990
You bought things using my tab.

279
00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.533
Work and pay it back.

280
00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:45.744
What? Make it a present!

281
00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:48.163
It's my birthday, you know!
<i>I don't care.</i>

282
00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:49.706
Cheapskate.
<i>Cheapskate?</i>

283
00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:51.959
Stingy wolf.
<i>Thief tanuki.</i>

284
00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.585
That's-- I mean...

285
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:06.807
…An immortal body, and someone who can transform their body beyond a beast form...

286
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:10.269
There's no way they're normal beastmen...

287
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:12.729
...these two.
