00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:09.284
<i>BEASTMEN SHOULD DIE</i>

3
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.080
<i>10 years have passed since the enforcement of the Beastmen Special Zone.
There's strong antipathy against...</i>

4
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.040
<i>...Beastmen Territory, and a protest at the front of the Congress is currently ongoing.</i>

5
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.510
<i>Now departing. All standing passengers...</i>

6
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.470
<i>...please hold onto the handrails.</i>

7
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.060
<i>Ever since we established the Beastmen Territory Law...</i>

8
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.150
<i>...we have managed to develop Animacity, a city where beastmen can...</i>

9
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.270
<i>...truly live as themselves.</i>

10
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.990
That's it!

11
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.990
<i>We are currently cooperating on the Beastmen
Special Zone Development Project.</i>

12
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.790
<i>Beast New Age
SYLVASTA Pharmaceuticals</i>

13
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.550
Damn it...

14
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.870
Ouch...

15
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.470
Damn beastman...

16
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.850
We can easily see through you!

17
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.150
This is the path that everyone who escapes Animacity takes.

18
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.820
You'll bite the dust if you stick around here!

19
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.940
Monsters like you are multiplying...

20
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.860
It's a goddamn eyesore!

21
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.280
Drop dead!

22
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.030
Excuse me!

23
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.250
Could you stop that~?

24
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.540
That kid is one of my precious customers.

25
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.420
Please be gentle.

26
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.510
Suddenly shooting an arrow at me...

27
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.060
Isn't that... a bit rude?

28
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.020
Let's dispose of these guys already.

29
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.530
It'd be a pain in the ass if you kill them, so try to hold back a bit.

30
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.010
The path to Animacity is ridded with beast hunters.

31
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.050
But you don't have to worry. I will be taking you there.

32
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.970
W-who are you?

33
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.350
I'm the one who extends her hand to beastmen in trouble...

34
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.850
...a loving volunteer, Mari Itami!

35
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.020
That's kind of shady.

36
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.230
Damn, you got me.

37
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.610
So how much is it?

38
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.990
I said I was a volunteer, though...

39
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.660
You're the type to charge me afterwards, right?

40
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.870
You're not too charming, are you?

41
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.500
If I had any charm, I wouldn't be here right now.

42
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.910
You're certainly right.

43
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.670
Guess I'll take all the money you have then.

44
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.040
Are you serious?!

45
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.090
It's the price for your life, so don't be stingy about it!

46
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.800
Am I right?

47
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.180
Don't say it so happily.

48
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.370
Is that city really only for beastmen?

49
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.450
Yep! Animacity.

50
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.000
Are you also an outlier?

51
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.010
Don't worry.

52
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.430
You'll be able to sleep properly from now on.

53
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.770
Yeah...

54
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.810
Alright, we're here.

55
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.730
Once you get off the boat, we're back to complete strangers.

56
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.030
Got it. Thank you!

57
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.060
What's this? It's way too quiet...

58
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.790
It's a festival!

59
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.630
It's the mayor!

60
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.380
Mayor Rose!
<i>It's the mayor!</i>

61
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.590
Mayor, let's go!

62
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.760
It's been ten years since Animacity was built.

63
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.560
The gap between beastmen and humans hasn't been closed yet.

64
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.770
Regardless, this city continues to be the safe haven for beastmen.

65
00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.270
These past ten years, and the following ten years...

66
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.230
No, for the sake of the future that lies beyond...

67
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.820
Let's celebrate the anniversary!

68
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.120
Everyone is really a beastman!

69
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.000
There's no need to run anymore!

70
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.990
Ah, I'm sorry... Huh?

71
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.910
Whoa...

72
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.700
What a nice smell...

73
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.500
It's the smell of beasts filled with joy and happiness.

74
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.870
What?

75
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.630
Celebrate. It's the festival that beastmen have waited for for a thousand years.

76
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.340
O-okay...

77
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.300
There are many types of people, huh...

78
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.930
He's crying... and he's scary.

79
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.350
What's up with that guy?

80
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.820
Mayor, it's from the Prime Minister, Shiramizu.

81
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.490
Congratulations on the ten-year anniversary, Mayor Rose.

82
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.450
It is all thanks to your comprehension.

83
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.330
Ahaha, don't get me wrong, though.

84
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.040
The Beastmen Special Zone isn't impenetrable.

85
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.130
If you beastmen start behaving dangerously...

86
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.090
I don't know what could happen, or when...

87
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.890
I'm sincerely counting on you.

88
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.360
Same as always, huh. I can't tell if he's celebrating or threatening us.

89
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.020
Even so, ten years have passed.

90
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.110
To Rose Barbarei's ten-year fight.

91
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.280
To ten more years of Animacity.

92
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.380
This is pretty strong!

93
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.050
Oh my, being a glutton? I knew you had more.

94
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:16.930
You're that weasel!

95
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.060
Not a weasel! A mink!

96
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.270
Really?

97
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.610
Don't confuse me with those cheap-fur animals!

98
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:24.940
Okay...

99
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.780
I said "all your money", didn't I?

100
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.650
Kids are so treacherous lately...

101
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.530
I won't give you any more money.

102
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.120
We're back to complete strangers, right?

103
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.540
Do I really look that selfish to you?

104
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.500
That makes me sad... So sad...

105
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.460
Ah! A thief!

106
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.590
Oh, poor thing.

107
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:52.130
Be careful~ Animacity is full of sneaky people like that.

108
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.710
Did you really...?!

109
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.550
You sure you wanna argue? The pickpocket is getting away.

110
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.720
Damn it!

111
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.560
Someone! Catch that pickpocket!

112
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.200
Hold it!

113
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.760
Where'd he go?

114
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.930
God damn it!

115
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.750
Move it!

116
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.250
Hurry up, grandpa!

117
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.630
Crapcrapcrapcrapcrap...!

118
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.350
Ouch...

119
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.520
You're the crying guy!

120
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.690
Wait, you're still crying.

121
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.830
It was you?! The one wrecked the beastmen festival?!

122
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.580
It wasn't me! I just punched a pillar!

123
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.210
And you made it explode?!

124
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.870
Are you for real?

125
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.380
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

126
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.300
That guy...

127
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.050
He was sneaking around those pillars!

128
00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.260
That guy?

129
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.670
It seems this was a misunderstanding. I'm sorry.

130
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.760
Huh?

131
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.350
The hell is up with that guy?

132
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.650
Right! The pickpocket!

133
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.080
What?

134
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.800
A bummer, isn't it? It was a smell-less bomb!

135
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.880
You can't tell even if you're a beastman!

136
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.680
Whoa!! The hell is this?!

137
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.150
That hurt...

138
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.360
Is this guy immortal or something?!

139
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.320
Spit it out. Why did you interrupt the festival?

140
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.740
Ouch...!

141
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.050
Huh, that was quick.

142
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.180
What's wrong, Satou? Did your trap fail?

143
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.680
Be careful...

144
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.140
That damn wolf... He completely outdid my bomb!

145
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.810
It seems they're pros.

146
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.120
I see...

147
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.210
Humans!

148
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.750
You bastards were bought out by humans, huh?

149
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.760
How could you tell, huh?

150
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.300
You cannot cover up such a deep human smell.

151
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.770
What an effective nose you have!

152
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.650
You were bought out by anti-beastmen humans...

153
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.860
You're pretty stuck on that "bought out" thing.

154
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.320
It doesn't matter if it's a human or a beastman.

155
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.240
When it comes to contracted work...

156
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.200
...we'll do it properly!

157
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.830
That's all there is to it!

158
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.670
Is that... why you ruined... the festival...?

159
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.630
You gotta be kidding me!

160
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.260
You damn...
W-whoa!

161
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.880
That sin...

162
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.840
You'll atone for it with your life.

163
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.980
You damn beastmen who sold their souls to humans...

164
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.740
You bastards aren't even worth using my claws on.

165
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.700
My fists are more than enough!

166
00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.280
Bring it on!

167
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.330
You better not regret it!

168
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.770
Let go!

169
00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.110
You, who lost the pride of a beastman...

170
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.610
...you don't need the pride of a deer!

171
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.990
Stop it... I beg you...!

172
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.740
My antlers... Anything but my...!

173
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.040
Stop right there, you greenhorn.

174
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.790
Branding me as a greenhorn...

175
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.350
Don't move!

176
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.810
If you move, this kid's life is done!

177
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.780
Whose life is done, you said?

178
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.700
Hold on!

179
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.700
That's horrible!

180
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.300
That's enough, isn't it? Those poor people!

181
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.590
Don't try to stop me. These guys ruined the festival.

182
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.510
They're beastmen too, though! This is...

183
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.560
These guys were hired by humans.

184
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.980
They're a disgrace to all beastmen.

185
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.350
That much is right.

186
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.480
Stop it!

187
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.530
I said stop it!

188
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.670
That's enough!

189
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.750
Why are you fighting against your own people?

190
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.220
Wasn't this city a "beastmen paradise"?

191
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.260
That's exactly why.

192
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.680
Humans are enemies to this city.

193
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.390
Beastmen hired by humans are the same.

194
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.850
Not all humans are like that!

195
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.320
All humans are the same.

196
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.190
That's not true!

197
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.150
Because...

198
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.030
...I'm also a human!

199
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.700
That's right...

200
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.160
I am a human...

201
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.830
...I <i>was</i> a human!

202
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.380
With that appearance?

203
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.930
